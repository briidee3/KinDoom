# KinDoom
A personal project with the intention of getting Doom (classic) to run on a Kindle 4(NT)

> *Currently on the back-burner, especially with school starting up again and all that.*

This is a random project of mine with the purpose of running Doom (more specifically, [chocolate-doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom)) on the Kindle 4 (NT).
I'm doing this mostly because it's funny, but also because it seemed like an interesting project, providing a lot of new things to learn as well as getting some experience doing a bit of what some may consider to be "hacking" (what is generally) a closed source file system, as is present on the Kindle 4.
If you're wondering why the Kindle 4 in particular--well, it's the one that I own and have access to, so yeah. (lol)

I'm also utilizing many other resources, in particular those that can be found on [this site](https://wiki.mobileread.com/wiki/K4_Index#Web_to_Kindle) as well as others on that domain. *(I've found it to be a great resource for Kindle hacking, as it has many great tutorials and even better programs to work with that can add/modify a lot of functionality of a Kindle, **including** getting lower level access to the linux-based filesystem that resides within the Kindle 4 via a usbNetwork hack)*

> I don't plan on coming back to this project any time too soon (although, don't get me wrong, I'd love too), since I have several other projects I want to get done, and, well, you know, priorities, lol. I do hope to get back to it eventually though, as I have a pretty good idea as to how to accomplish the goal of this project. My plan, if I ever come back to this project, is to install the necessary packages to run Doom on a lightweight device running Xorg (which is the display server used on the Kindle 4 NT); however, the Kindle (as you may have guessed) doesn't come with a built in package manager. Thus, the necessary packages (and their dependencies) must be compiled from source on the Kindle (via command line); that is more or less the bulk of the plan, should I come back to this project. Once all that is installed, it should be relatively easy to configure things and get Doom running on there (which would be *hilarious). Anyways, if anyone has any questions about this, feel free to let me know! Otherwise, it's time for me to get to work on some other projects...
